"""
AirAd Backend — Security Alerting Framework

Detects and logs security-relevant anomalies:
- Repeated login failures from the same IP
- Privilege escalation attempts (accessing above role)
- Large data exports (bulk download anomaly)

Phase A: Alerts are logged to the structured logger with level CRITICAL.
Phase B: Integrate with an external alerting service (PagerDuty, Slack webhook, etc.).

All alert functions are designed to be called from services.py or middleware.
They NEVER block the request — fire-and-forget logging only.

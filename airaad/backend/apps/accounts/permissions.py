AirAd Backend — RBAC Permission Classes (R3)

RolePermission.for_roles() is the ONLY RBAC mechanism in the entire codebase.
No scattered `if user.role ==` checks are permitted anywhere.

Usage in views:
    permission_classes = [RolePermission.for_roles(AdminRole.SUPER_ADMIN, AdminRole.CITY_MANAGER)]

    """Base RBAC permission class. Use for_roles() — never instantiate directly.

    Subclasses are created dynamically by for_roles() with the allowed_roles
    tuple set as a class attribute. This ensures each view's permission class
    is a distinct type, which DRF inspects correctly for OpenAPI generation.

    No __call__ method — class-based only.

    Attributes:
        allowed_roles: Tuple of AdminRole values permitted to access the view.
            Empty by default — denies all access unless overridden by for_roles().
